# Wifi-CSI-Based-Activity-Recognition

Leveraging the ubiquity of WiFi devices to monitor daily activities without the privacy concerns associated with vision-based methods. Collection CSI data for several different human activities, converting the data into images used as inputs for a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed CSI-based HAR system.

## Overview

The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought significant advancements in Human Activity Recognition (HAR), particularly for smart homes. This project focuses on using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) to recognize human activities. The method leverages the ubiquity of WiFi devices to monitor activities without the privacy concerns associated with camera-based methods.

## Key Features

- Utilizes CSI data from WiFi signals for HAR.
- Collects data using a Raspberry Pi 4 and/or ESP32.
- Converts CSI data to images for use with a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
