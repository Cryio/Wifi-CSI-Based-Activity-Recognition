# Wifi-CSI-Based-Activity-Recognition
Leveraging the ubiquity of WiFi devices to monitor daily activities without the privacy concerns associated with vision-based methods. Collection CSI data for several different human activities, converting the data into images used as inputs for a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed CSI-based HAR system.
